# Ironhold-lib (Bevy 0.17) — Data‑Driven, Cross‑Platform Game Runtime (Native + Web/WASM)

**Ironhold-lib** is a **cross-platform** (Windows/Linux + WebAssembly) game runtime built on **Bevy 0.17**.  
Games are defined by **data files** (`.ron`) and assets (models, textures, audio). Game creators can build new projects and scenes **without recompiling** the engine.

> **Core idea:** the engine ships “capability building blocks” (controller, camera, animation, UI, etc.) and the **project + scene data** decides what gets used.

---

## ✨ What you can do today

- Load a **project** from `assets/project.ron`
- Load a **scene** from `assets/scenes/*.ron`
- Spawn **models** from `.glb`
- Optional **player** with:
  - configurable input mapping (WASD etc.)
  - orbit camera
  - configurable animation mapping
- UI **Button** that triggers `LoadScene(...)`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1) Native (Windows / Linux / macOS)

```bash
cargo run -p ironhold_native
```

This runs the Bevy app using the shared runtime in `ironhold_core` and loads:
- `assets/project.ron`
- the configured initial scene (e.g. `assets/scenes/start-menu.ron`)

---

### 2) Web / WASM

#### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain installed
- `wasm-pack` installed
- WASM target installed

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

#### Build
```bash
wasm-pack build crates/ironhold_web --target web
```

#### Serve (any static server)
From the repo root:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open:
- `http://localhost:8000`

> `index.html` loads the generated WASM package and starts the engine.

## 🎮 Creating a Game (Data‑Driven)

### Project file: `assets/project.ron`

Minimal project config selects the initial scene:

```ron
(
  initial_scene: "scenes/start-menu.ron",
)
```

### Scene files: `assets/scenes/*.ron`

A scene defines:
- `models`: list of `.glb` models to spawn
- `ui`: UI elements (e.g. buttons)
- `player`: optional player config (model + camera + inputs + animations)

Example (conceptual shape; see your current `assets/scenes/*.ron` for real fields):

```ron
(
  models: [
    (path: "models/anvil.glb", position: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)),
  ],
  ui: [
    (Button: (text: "Start Game", action: (LoadScene: "scenes/main.ron"))),
  ],
  player: Some((
    model_path: "models/character-01.glb",
    initial_position: (0.0, 0.0, 2.0),
    inputs: (
      forward: "KeyW",
      backward: "KeyS",
      left: "KeyA",
      right: "KeyD",
      jump: "Space",
      run: "ShiftLeft",
    ),
    camera: (
      orbit_speed: 0.01,
      zoom_speed: 0.2,
      min_radius: 2.0,
      max_radius: 8.0,
    ),
    animations: (
      idle: "Idle",
      walk: "Walk",
      run: "Run",
    ),
  )),
)
```

## 🧠 Architecture Direction (Why + Where We’re Going)

Ironhold-lib is moving toward a stable runtime model that supports:
- global logic (menus, flow, quests)
- per-entity logic (interactables, NPC behaviors)
- future multiplayer (server-authoritative and/or rollback)

### Target runtime structure
**Messages (events) → Interpreter (data logic) → Actions → Executors**

- Capability systems emit messages (input, UI, triggers…)
- Data-defined logic interprets messages and outputs actions
- Capability executors apply actions (move, play animation, load scene…)

This keeps the engine generic and lets creators define behavior purely in `.ron`.

## 📚 Documentation

We are adding a docs folder to make architecture + decisions part of the repo:

- `docs/00_overview.md` — overview
- `docs/10_architecture.md` — architecture + reasoning
- `docs/20_data_formats.md` — project/scene schema guidance
- `docs/30_runtime_events_and_logic.md` — messages/actions + FSM plan
- `docs/40_determinism_and_networking.md` — determinism + multiplayer strategy
- `docs/50_roadmap_and_milestones.md` — beta milestones + implementation order
- `docs/60_contributing.md` — contributing guidelines

(See `plan.md` for current notes; these docs will become the canonical plan.)

## 🧭 Roadmap & Beta Milestones (Stable Foundations First)

We’re planning stable beta milestones that “freeze the foundations” before adding lots of new features:

- **Beta 0.1 — Baseline Runtime**  
  Current functionality stabilized + documented (native + web parity).
- **Beta 0.2 — Event/Action Bus**  
  Decouple systems via messages + actions (refactor, no behavior change).
- **Beta 0.3 — Global Logic (FSM v1)**  
  Project-level state machine in data (menus/flow).
- **Beta 0.4 — Entity Logic (FSM v1)**  
  Per-entity behaviors in data (triggers/interactions).
- **Beta 0.5 — Deterministic Tick + Replay**  
  Fixed tick core, deterministic RNG, input capture/replay.
- **Beta 0.6 — Networking Prototype**  
  Minimal multiplayer proving the architecture.

Full details live in `docs/50_roadmap_and_milestones.md`.

## 🛠 Development Notes

### Assets folder discovery
The runtime expects an `assets/` directory at or near the executable working directory.
The engine includes logic to locate the assets folder (including walking up parent folders),
so running from workspace root is usually fine.

### Data validation (planned)
We will add stricter schema validation (and schema versioning) so that
invalid scene/project configs produce actionable errors.
