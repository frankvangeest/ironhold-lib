## Performance


- ~~**Extend pipeline warmup to cover Text2d and UI pipelines**~~ _(promoted to backlog `e02d9e1` 2026-05-05; see `planning/features/pipeline_warmup_2d_ui.md`)_

- **Particle texture atlas for ≤4 total draw calls** _(observed at `0221d9e` 2026-05-19)_ — The pool renderer gives O(distinct textures) draw calls; the campfire's 6 Kenney flame sprites still cost 6 draw calls — packing them into one atlas PNG at startup (or as a prebuilt asset) and remapping UVs would hit the ≤4 target. Concrete basis: campfire_body uses sprites: [flame_01..04] = 4 groups, campfire_core [flame_05..06] = 2 groups.


## Particles / Visual

- **Glow halo layer on fire effects (SDR-safe "fake bloom")** _(observed at `a16bd98` 2026-05-23)_ — Add a third layer to `campfire_fire` (and similar fire effects): a large (size ~1.5), near-transparent (alpha ~0.06 start, 0.0 end), additive-blend, solid-orange quad with zero spread and slow drift upward; this approximates the soft halo bloom would add without touching HDR or post-processing. Concrete basis: investigated while implementing and reverting Bloom — the existing multi-layer EffectDef system supports this entirely in RON with no code changes.
