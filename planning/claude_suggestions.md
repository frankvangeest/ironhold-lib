## Performance


- ~~**Extend pipeline warmup to cover Text2d and UI pipelines**~~ _(promoted to backlog `e02d9e1` 2026-05-05; see `planning/features/pipeline_warmup_2d_ui.md`)_

- **Particle texture atlas for ≤4 total draw calls** _(observed at `0221d9e` 2026-05-19)_ — The pool renderer gives O(distinct textures) draw calls; the campfire's 6 Kenney flame sprites still cost 6 draw calls — packing them into one atlas PNG at startup (or as a prebuilt asset) and remapping UVs would hit the ≤4 target. Concrete basis: campfire_body uses sprites: [flame_01..04] = 4 groups, campfire_core [flame_05..06] = 2 groups.
